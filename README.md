# Abs_Sentence_Transformer_Summarization

Abstractive summarization techniques emulate human writing by generating entirely new sentences to convey key concepts from the source text, rather than merely rephrasing portions of it.
The term “Transformers” has recently dominated the natural language processing field, although these models initially relied on designs based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
